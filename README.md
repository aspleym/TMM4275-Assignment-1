## Task

You have founded a company implementing KBE systems for various manufacturers. This time you have received an offer to build the KBE for the factory making furniture. In particular, a parametric design of a chair shall be made. Customers should be able to define the “sizes”/”shapes” of different elements of the chair and observe the result as well as if it is possible to make. Customer wishes should be checked with the capabilities at the production floor.

### Built With

Everyone that contributed to the project used Visual Studio Code to develop this software. The next section has a list of libraries and applications that have been used in this project. The names are linked to one of the developers home page for the library.

#### Libraries

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)
- [http.server](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html)
- [socketserver](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socketserver.html)
- [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/)
- [os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html)
- [json](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project you would need to install [Python](https://www.python.org/) to run the website and [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) if you are on a OSX system to run the Fuseki server.

### Download project

This section will guide you to clone this git repository. Type the following lines in the terminal (for **_unix_** users):

```sh
cd /to-your-desired-directory
git clone https://github.com/aspleym/TMM4275-Assignment-1.git
cd TMM4275-Assignment-1
```

You are now inside the project folder.

Type `ls` in the terminal to see the root folder structure.

### Run the system

In this section you will be guided step by step on how to run the system on your computer.
#### Fuseki server
-
#### Adding OWL model

#### Webserver
- Start by opening a termnial of your choise.
- Type the following to execute the webserver:
```sh
cd /to-project-directory

```
- A new window should open. Click on the folder named `Git`, select `Projects from Git` and hit the button named `Next >`.
- Select: `Existing local repository` and proceed by pressing the `Next >` button.
- There should be a button with the name `Add...` to add a git repository.
  - Another window will pop up. Type in the path to the git project's directory, or use the `Browse...` button to find the path.
  - In the search results, check the box for the git project you want to add to your workspace. The directory should look something like `/you-directory/TDT4250Project/.git`.
  - Press the `Finish` button to close the window, and the `Next >` button to proceed.
- You should now see how the working tree will look like when you import the project. No changes should be needed, proceed by clicking the `Next >` button.
- The next window will show you the different projects that will be added to the workspace. Just hit the `Finish` button to finalize the import.
- The Project should now be imported into Eclipse and you can view each bundle in the _Package Explorer_.
